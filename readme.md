This repository will be used for zenika nightclazz on introduction to javascript frameworks.

Here we use angular, react and vue to create the same small application from scratch and explore the concept of components in each of them.

For the `reactAndVue` demo, it is required to serve the folder through a server for the react component to work. So for example you can run: 
- `cd reactAndVue`
- `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`
